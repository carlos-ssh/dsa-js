# Static & Dynamic Arrays

## Static Arrays

Static arrays are arrays that have a fixed size. They are declared with a fixed size and cannot be resized. Static arrays are allocated on the stack and are therefore faster than dynamic arrays. They are also more memory efficient than dynamic arrays.

## Dynamic Arrays

Dynamic arrays are arrays that have a variable size. They are declared with a variable size and can be resized. Dynamic arrays are allocated on the heap and are therefore slower than static arrays. They are also less memory efficient than static arrays.

## Static vs Dynamic Arrays

Static arrays are faster and more memory efficient than dynamic arrays. Dynamic arrays are slower and less memory efficient than static arrays.

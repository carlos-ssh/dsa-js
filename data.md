# Memory, Addressing and Data Types

## Memory

Memory is a collection of bytes. Each byte is a collection of 8 bits. Each bit can be either 0 or 1. Each byte can be represented by a hexadecimal number. For example, the byte 00000000 is represented by 0x00, the byte 00000001 is represented by 0x01, the byte 00000010 is represented by 0x02, and so on. The byte 11111111 is represented by 0xFF.

## Addressing

Each byte in memory has a unique address. The address of a byte is a hexadecimal number. For example, the address of the byte 00000000 is 0x00, the address of the byte 00000001 is 0x01, the address of the byte 00000010 is 0x02, and so on. The address of the byte 11111111 is 0xFF.

## Data Types

A data type is a set of values and a set of operations that can be performed on those values. For example, the data type `int` is a set of integers and a set of operations that can be performed on those integers. The data type `char` is a set of characters and a set of operations that can be performed on those characters.

## Data Types in JavaScript

JavaScript has 6 data types:

  * `number`
  * `string`
  * `boolean`
  * `null`
  * `undefined`
  * `symbol`


## `number`

The `number` data type is a set of integers and a set of operations that can be performed on those integers. For example, the `number` data type is a set of the integers 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25, 26, 27, 28, 29, 30, 31, 32, 33, 34, 35, 36, 37, 38, 39, 40, 41, 42, 43, 44, 45, 46, 47, 48, 49, 50, 51, 52, 53, 54, 55, 56, 57, 58, 59, 60, 61, 62, 63, 64, 65, 66, 67, 68, 69, 70, 71, 72, 73, 74, 75, 76, 77, 78, 79, 80, 81, 82, 83, 84, 85, 86, 87, 88, 89, 90, 91, 92, 93, 94, 95, 96, 97, 98, 99, 100, 101, 102, 103, 104, 105, 106, 107, 108, 109, 110, 111, 112, 113, 114, 115, 116, 117, 118, 119, 120, 121, 122, 123, 124, 125, 126, 127, 128, 129, 130, 131, 132, 133, 134, 135, 136, 137, 138, 139, 140, 141, 142, 143, 144, 145, 146, 147, 148, 149, 150, 151, 152, 153

## Methods

The `number` data type has 3 methods:

  * `toString()`
  * `toFixed()`
  * `toPrecision()`

The `toString()` method returns a string representation of a number. For example, the `toString()` method returns the string `"42"` when called on the number `42`.

The `toFixed()` method returns a string representation of a number with a specified number of decimal places. For example, the `toFixed()` method returns the string `"42.00"` when called on the number `42` with a specified number of decimal places of `2`.

The `toPrecision()` method returns a string representation of a number with a specified number of significant digits. For example, the `toPrecision()` method returns the string `"42.0"` when called on the number `42` with a specified number of significant digits of `3`.

## Properties

The `number` data type has 1 property:

  * `MAX_VALUE`


The `MAX_VALUE` property returns the largest number that can be represented in JavaScript. For example, the `MAX_VALUE` property returns the number `1.7976931348623157e+308` when called on the `number` data type.


## Methods

**push:** Add an item to the end of an array

**pop:** Remove an item from the end of an array

**unshift:** Add an item to the beginning of an array

**shift:** Remove an item from the beginning of an array

**splice:** Remove an item by index position
